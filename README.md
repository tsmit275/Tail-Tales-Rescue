# Tail-Tales-Rescue-

Tail Tales Rescue is a company dedicated to finding forever homes for our animals in the southeast region. Take a tour through our website stopping at the animals page to view a full gallery of our adoptable pets. To see a full description of the individual pet, just click on the image of the animal you're interested in.

Feel free to contact us by submitting your information and questions, and someone will respond to you within 24-48 hours.

If you are interested in volunteering to help our animals and keep our mission going strong, please visit the volunteer page and submit your information for our administrators to review. You can also upload your resume and include a photo of any pets you have already.
